        <h2>Chinese Dramas Gallery</h2>
        <p>I'm a fan of chinese dramas. My favourite genre is historical costume dramas.
            This is because the dramas play a key role of educating people about chinese culture
            as well as entertaining them.<br>
            I get to learn more about the several chinese dynasties and each dynasty had a different 
            way of doing things including their way of dressing and showing respect.

        <h2>Chinese Cuisine Menu</h2>
        <p>There is a variety of chinese food. But I've just included the most common
            food, that is dumplings and noodles. However, the main staple food in China is Rice.<br> 
            They take rice porridge and it's reffered to as congee.<br>
            There's also rice cakes.
